- **Clean and Intuitive UI**: Designed with user experience in mind, the interface is straightforward and easy to navigate.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (v12 or later)
- **npm** (v6 or later)
- A running instance of the ChatApp backend (Strapi)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YashLT224/ChatApp-Frontend.git
   cd ChatApp-Frontend
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the application locally.

1. **Start the React application:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This command will start the development server and open the application in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- **Register or Log In**: Start by registering a new user or logging in with existing credentials.
- **Send and Receive Messages**: Type your message in the input field and press "Enter" or click "Send" to send your message. The server will echo the message back to you.
- **Persistent Chat**: Your chat history is stored locally, so even after refreshing the page, your previous messages will still be visible.
